Description: This is my digital my resume. My main goal is to offer a more complete version of my resume.

At this moment, the app features 4 sections (professional, academic, hobbies and portfolio) and a basic search function.

I will add videos to each section, but at the moment you will see it commented.

Project built with ReactJS. Currently based on class components. I am not excluding to rewrite it with function components.

Components list:

* App
  * Ficha
    * Description
      * Project_HTML
        * Desc_Container
  * Portfolio
* Search
  * Summary_HTML
 
Most of content is now stored in the data folder, including the big pieces of HTML, like the projects (lacomuna.js, lambdalogic.js, neoris.js).

The description.json is an helper for the search function, listing relevant keywords in function of the relevant piece of information.

At this stage, I am still organizing the data and the code. Some data are still left in the code, hardcoded, sorry about that :)
